# crypt-django

## Hi there,
crytp-django is the webapp which encrypts and decrypts the text you enter. It is working based on the concept similar to ceaser cipher.
This is developed using Django framework available in python. The front end is developed using HTML5 and CSS3.
If you are interested to change the encryption algorithm just fork it and change to whatever algorithm you want. 
Have fun!
